I know everyone's different, but still great insight.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to assume that now you probably have a good number of cold contacts like these but I'll shoot my shot anyways. I will be attempting to get into ML Eng/Ops or Data Eng and wiggle my way through from a SD/SE. At some point in the near future, could I ask you to review and get feedback on my self-marketing, presentation and maybe get a sanity check on what my plans to achieve the above are?\n\nKind regards,\n\n",

I thought it may make more sense to message you here - but would you be open to letting me buy your family's coffee, or your lunch to take a virtual meet or phone call with me?\n\nContext below - but I think you're an ideal person to ask for guidance/advice for where I'm at and where I'm trying to go professionally.\n\nLong story context dump - my background is in sales and technical recruitment. My skills are soft/subjective, but over the last couple months I've been working to change that. (*If you're interested in a secret that only 5 people know*) - my wife and I are expecting, and that has put some high octane into my motivation to build a better career. My 'strategy' is to grow my technical foundation knowledge base to be more effective my role today, and to expand a role I just started with an AI/ML Solutions provider into a Sales Solutions type role.\n\nThat's where I'm at currently - day job still recruiting, and learning as much as I can. Currently my learning development is half educational taking AZ-900 course with the goal of the AZ-305 Solutions, and half conceptual - current landscape/context which is where I found you. Your materials, just resonate.\n\nI have a lot of respect and interest in highly intelligent people - especially ones with that Feynman-esque ability to speak clearly about complex topics.\n\nCertainly this is unorthodox, but hopefully not off-putting or presumptuous to assume you would make the time - BUT if you're open to it, I'd be happy to send you a gift card or buy your lunch or something to have a phone call or Zoom for your time.\n\nIf not, no worries at all, still wish you all the best,\n\n",

After a few years of working as a data analyst/data scientist I was definitely over the conversation always being about statistics or algorithms or experimentation.\n\nWhat I do really like is developing ML systems and the infrastructure (pipelines, monitoring, testing, etc) around ML models. So I targeted most of my efforts towards the ML Infra/Ops types of roles. Most of the companies I talked to (9 I interviewed with) really loved that fact that I asked for my next role to be squarely focused on everything except for the data science and ML aspects.\n\nWhat area of ML are you trying to get into? Research or engineering/ops?",

        "prompt": "I'm mostly trying to get into engineering. What are interviews like for ML roles? Are algorithm interviews still a part of it? Or statistics questions maybe?\n\nI think I might still be about a year away from being able to jump into ML, but I'm interested in how I can best prepare myself. So I'm taking the deep learning Udacity course and I'm getting an MS in computational linguistics while working full time as a full stack dev, but I'm interested if there are other things I could or should be looking at to get more practice and prepare myself, particularly for the interview cycles.",
        "response": "There's 2 types of interviews for ML Engineer roles, which I'd call the FAANG style vs holistic.\n\nFAANG style involves a round of Leetcode DS&A questions, a round or two of Machine Learning & Data Science theory questions, and a round of experimentation/statistical theory. I did badly in those types of interviews and didn't pass the tech screens even spending a 1+ months purely studying DS&A. I figured at a certain point it wasn't really worth it to try to cram for the FAANG style interviews & focused my energies on companies with holistic interviewing processes.\n\nThe holistic style involved a round of live system design (with a take-home component potentially), two rounds of panel interviews: 1 round with 2-3 senior + staff engineers on project & experience walkthrough (focus on tools, system design, best-practices), 1 round with 2-3 senior + principal or director data scientists asking about DS/ML theory & execution. No Leetcode or live coding tech screen. My three offers came from this bucket.\n\nOut of 9 companies, a slight majority did FAANG style or a blend of FAANG & holistic but it's hard to interview in the MLE area. Ultimately it comes down to whether someone has built projects using some of the MLOps & MLE tools and libraries out there.\n\nI think the best prep if you want to go the MLOps/MLE route is to build some end-to-end projects (with feature engineering, model development, serving, monitoring, etc) and supplement with some of the learning material out there like the Full Stack Deep Learning course, case studies, and going deep on specific tools. Even though my friend's startup wasn't a full-time gig, that's what got everyone's attention, because I helped develop the data engineering and model deployment infrastructure and pipelines. I also watched videos from the Stanford ML Systems playlist.",
