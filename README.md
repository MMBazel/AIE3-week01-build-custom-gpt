Week 1 Assignment 1: Breaking Into Data & MLOps^TM - By MikikoGPT

I created a custom GPT called "Breaking Into Data & MLOps^TM" that helps people get answers on pivotting to data analytics, science, or MLOps.
I get a ton of messages on LI from people asking me for advice and help, partially because of my role as a DevRel but also because I spent a couple years creating various forms of content about my journey becoming a data scientist without a masters or PhD. 
The messages tend to be pretty similar and often times involves re-directing folks to blog posts or videos I've already crated (but that tend to be really long because I consume ins tream but produce in batch). 

Could I outsource answering messages so that not only am I able to focus on long-tail cases but I can also unblock the folks that ask me for help? 

So I created MikikoGPT. 

Other reasons why I liked this direction: 

I essentially have an easily accessible, reasonable size training data based on content that I personally created and that I can speak to the ownership & provenance;
I can evaluate the quality of the responses based on actual conversations;
I can share the GPT as a useful resource as well as customize further as an internal tool.

What I learned
The Pros
In cases that don’t require a lot of personalization (for example, the message is generic or short), MikikoGPT can give a reasonably comprehensive response in a minute fraction of the time that I can.
Adding memory (especially the linkedin timeline) is really helpful for some grounding.
Especially in cases where I’ve written very long posts, using a chat-interface can help deliver the 80/20 of information in a digestible format.

The Limitations
Details can get lost, especially with regards to specific links and technology.
Although MikikoGPT captured the spirit of the advice I’d give in most cases, it didn’t necessarily offer strong opinions, which I think is one of my primary value-propositions.
There’s additional information I usually leverage as part of my recommendations, including the candidate’s goals, their LinkedIn profile, experiences and skills.
Hallucinations and links: Although MikikoGPT did reference the uploaded documents at times, links weren’t given even though the blog posts I’ve written included at least 50 links of resources. 
Maybe because the files were uploaded as pdfs and some of the links didn’t get pulled in?

Questions I still have 
How can I ensure that MikikoGPT is updated with recent, relevant information?
What are the boundaries of MikikoGPT and how do I maintain or influence them?
I.e. What do I want MikikoGPT to do versus when do I want MikikoGPT to redirect users to contact me directly? 
The tone and style still feel more like ChatGPT and less like me.
How can I safely integrate MikikoGPT to take actions on my behalf but also have a review and intervention stage so I can update or influence the response?
Finally, how can I make sure MikikoGPT is being fine-tuned when needed?
